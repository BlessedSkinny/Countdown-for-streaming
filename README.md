# Countdown for streaming
#### Use this simple Java app to add a countdown to your stream!
When you start the countdown it creates a .txt file, called <strong>timer.txt</strong>, in the same directory where the .jar file is and you must read it using your favourite streaming software (OBS, XSplit, etc).
