# Countdown for streaming
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acerbisgianluca/Countdown-for-streaming.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acerbisgianluca/Countdown-for-streaming)
### Add a countdown to your stream using this simple app!
When you start the countdown it creates a .txt file, called <strong>timer.txt</strong>, in the same directory where the .jar file is, by selecting the option, and you can read it using your favourite streaming software (OBS, XSplit, etc).<br>
###If you don't know how to add a text source in your stream read [this](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Sources-Guide#text-gdi).<br>
#### You can download latest stable version from [here](https://github.com/acerbisgianluca/Countdown-for-streaming/releases/latest), but remember to keep lib folder and .jar file always together!!<br>
